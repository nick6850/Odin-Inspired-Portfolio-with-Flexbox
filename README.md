# Odin Inspired Portfolio with Flexbox
 Portfolio prototype created as a practice project while learning front-end development through The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this prototype was to design and build an entire webpage layout from scratch using CSS flexbox for layout and positioning. It was inspired by a portfolio design provided in Odin Project lessons to practice implementing flexbox concepts in a multi-section page.
